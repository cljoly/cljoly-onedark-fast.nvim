# onedark-fast.nvim

**Work in progress**

Port of [onedark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim) to [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/), so that we generate fast Lua code.

A few highlight group might still refer to NVim default colorscheme. They can be found by running `:highlight` and then searching the output for `Nvim`.
